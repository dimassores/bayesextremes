# Baysian Exploration for Extreme Values

[WIP] These repository has my personal exploration of bayesian techniques to deal with extreme values. To do so, traditional approach are implemented based on extreme value theory, based on paper such as "A semiparametric Bayesian approach to extreme value estimation" and personal approach are experiments, using gamma mixture model and poisson mixture model.
